# Furnidata Generator
Furnidata Generator for Arcturus Morningstar emulator. Just input the parameters the program will ask you for and it will automatically print the entire <furnitype></furnitype> container.

Use this generator only if you are using Arcturus Morningstar emulator, because it gets some parameters like the furni dimensions from the items_base table of the database, so the generator will only ask you for the required parameters for the furni to work.

How to use it:
1. Copy the code (or download the file and execute it) and paste it into a Java IDE.
2. Run it.
3. Input the parameters the program asks for.
4. Copy the printed furnidata and paste it in your furnidata.xml file.
